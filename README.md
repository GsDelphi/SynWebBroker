# SynWebBroker

Adds support for WebBroker to mORMot's TSQLHttpServer. Simply create a TSQLWebBrokerServer instance instead of a TSQLHttpServer.

In preparation:

* Authentification (not tested so far)
* WebApp (TWebApplication descendant)
* Standalone version with direct usage of the API server

Currently tested with Delphi XE3, but should work from Delphi 6 up to Delphi 10.3 Rio
